        description = "LEARN HOW TO MAKE A BEAUTIFUL SUSHI BUDDHA BOWL WITH A SESAME DRESSING\n\nLAY HO MA!!  If you've been following this channel you'll know that there are two things that bring me so much joy, and that is vegan ramen and vegan sushi.  Today, we're not going to be rolling anything up but making a beautiful buddha bowl that's sushi style.  Join me in this episode and learn how to make an easy tofu sushi bowl with an aromatic and luscious sesame dressing.  Let's begin.\n\nIngredients:\n\nSUSHI BOWL:\n1/2 cup sushi rice\n1/2 cup water\n1/2 cup carrot (matchsticks)\n1/2 cup cucumber (matchsticks)\n1 radish\n1 stick green onion\n1/4 lb extra firm tofu\n1/4 red bell pepper\n1 tbsp olive oil\nsalt and pepper\n2 tbsp rice vinegar\n1 tbsp white sesame seeds\n1 tbsp black sesame seeds\n1/2 cup green leaf lettuce (chopped)\n2 tbsp edamame beans\nfew slices pickled ginger ( https://youtu.be/huBM4lBKJpk)\n\nDRESSING:\n2 tbsp soy sauce\n2 tbsp lemon juice\n1 tsp toasted sesame oil\n1 tbsp cane sugar\n1/4 cup tahini\n1 tbsp black sesame seeds\n\nDirections:\n1. Place the sushi rice into a small saucepan.  Rinse and drain a couple of times to get rid of the excess starch.  Then, add 1/2 cup water and heat the rice up on medium high heat\n2. When the water just starts to bubble, give the rice a good stir to release any rice that is grabbing the bottom of the pan.  Then, cover and cook on medium low for 15min\n3. Chop the carrot and cucumber into matchsticks.  Thinly slice the radish.  Finely chop the green onion\n4. Pat dry the tofu and slice into strips\n5. Finely slice the red bell pepper\n6. After 15min, turn the heat off and let the rice steam further for another 10min\n7. Heat up a non stick pan to medium heat.  Add the olive oil and sear the tofu for 1-2min on each side.  Season the tofu with salt and pepper.  Set the tofu aside when done\n8. Add a pinch of salt, the rice vinegar, white sesame seeds, and black sesame seeds to the rice.  Give it a mix\n9. Plate the rice and let it cool for 5-10min\n10. Add on the lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, red bell pepper, tofu, radishes, green onion, and edamame beans.  Thinly slice the pickled ginger and add to the bowl.\n11. Carefully peel half of an (just ripe) avocado.  Thinly slice it width wise using the tip of the knife (will help prevent it from stick to the blade).  Shape the avocado into a rose and add to the bowl\n12. Make the dressing by combining the dressing ingredients in a small mason jar and shake until emulsified\n13. Pour over the dressing and serve \n\n\nORDER YOUR SIGNED VEGAN RAMEN COOKBOOK + GET YOUR FREE E-BOOK + TAKE YOUR VEGAN SUSHI MASTERCLASS HERE:\nhttps://www.yeungmancooking.com\n\nIf you enjoyed this episode and would love to see more, remember to like, comment, and subscribe so that you won't miss a single episode!\n\nHong Kong born Canadian, Wil Yeung is an international photographer, filmmaker, entrepreneur, violinist, and YouTube chef.
