Use method 1 and remove as much of the sticker labels as you can\n2. Take a kitchen towel with some olive oil and scrub against the sticker labels\n\nMETHOD 3\n1. Use method 1 and 2.\n2. Soak the entire jar in hot water for about 20 seconds.\n3. Scrap off the sticker labels and adhesive down with a wooden or bamboo spatula, while soaking the jar in hot water in between srcubs\n4.
