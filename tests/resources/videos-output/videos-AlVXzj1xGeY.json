                "description": "LEARN HOW TO MAKE A BEAUTIFUL SUSHI BUDDHA BOWL WITH A SESAME DRESSING\n\nLAY HO MA!!  If you've been following this channel you'll know that there are two things that bring me so much joy, and that is vegan ramen and vegan sushi.  Today, we're not going to be rolling anything up but making a beautiful buddha bowl that's sushi style.  Join me in this episode and learn how to make an easy tofu sushi bowl with an aromatic and luscious sesame dressing.  Let's begin.\n\nIngredients:\n\nSUSHI BOWL:\n1/2 cup sushi rice\n1/2 cup water\n1/2 cup carrot (matchsticks)\n1/2 cup cucumber (matchsticks)\n1 radish\n1 stick green onion\n1/4 lb extra firm tofu\n1/4 red bell pepper\n1 tbsp olive oil\nsalt and pepper\n2 tbsp rice vinegar\n1 tbsp white sesame seeds\n1 tbsp black sesame seeds\n1/2 cup green leaf lettuce (chopped)\n2 tbsp edamame beans\nfew slices pickled ginger ( https://youtu.be/huBM4lBKJpk)\n\nDRESSING:\n2 tbsp soy sauce\n2 tbsp lemon juice\n1 tsp toasted sesame oil\n1 tbsp cane sugar\n1/4 cup tahini\n1 tbsp black sesame seeds\n\nDirections:\n1. Place the sushi rice into a small saucepan.  Rinse and drain a couple of times to get rid of the excess starch.  Then, add 1/2 cup water and heat the rice up on medium high heat\n2. When the water just starts to bubble, give the rice a good stir to release any rice that is grabbing the bottom of the pan.  Then, cover and cook on medium low for 15min\n3. Chop the carrot and cucumber into matchsticks.  Thinly slice the radish.  Finely chop the green onion\n4. Pat dry the tofu and slice into strips\n5. Finely slice the red bell pepper\n6. After 15min, turn the heat off and let the rice steam further for another 10min\n7. Heat up a non stick pan to medium heat.  Add the olive oil and sear the tofu for 1-2min on each side.  Season the tofu with salt and pepper.  Set the tofu aside when done\n8. Add a pinch of salt, the rice vinegar, white sesame seeds, and black sesame seeds to the rice.  Give it a mix\n9. Plate the rice and let it cool for 5-10min\n10. Add on the lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, red bell pepper, tofu, radishes, green onion, and edamame beans.  Thinly slice the pickled ginger and add to the bowl.\n11. Carefully peel half of an (just ripe) avocado.  Thinly slice it width wise using the tip of the knife (will help prevent it from stick to the blade).  Shape the avocado into a rose and add to the bowl\n12. Make the dressing by combining the dressing ingredients in a small mason jar and shake until emulsified\n13. Pour over the dressing and serve \n\n\nORDER YOUR SIGNED VEGAN RAMEN COOKBOOK + GET YOUR FREE E-BOOK + TAKE YOUR VEGAN SUSHI MASTERCLASS HERE:\nhttps://www.yeungmancooking.com\n\nIf you enjoyed this episode and would love to see more, remember to like, comment, and subscribe so that you won't miss a single episode!\n\nHong Kong born Canadian, Wil Yeung is an international photographer, filmmaker, entrepreneur, violinist, and YouTube chef.

                "description": "LEARN HOW TO MAKE PICKLED GINGER, SUSHI RICE, and a THICK CHICKPEA MAYO for VEGAN SUSHI!\n\nLAY HO MA!!  Welcome to a preview of the full 1st class as part of the 5 class series in the exclusive vegan sushi masterclass.  I'm so proud to have us making incredible sushi together right at home.  In this 1st class, you will learn how to make sushi rice without a rice cooker, a beautiful pink pickled ginger, and a thick mayonnaise all in preparation for making some stunning sushi.  In the other 4 classes, you'll learn how to make a simple veggie roll, a crispy broccolini roll, a dynamite roll, and the incredible premium nigiri platter.  For more information on this epic menu masterclass, visit the link below:\n\nhttps://www.yeungmancooking.com\n\n\nSUSHI RICE ON STOVETOP (without a rice cooker)\n\nIngredients:\n2 cups uncooked sushi rice\r3 tbsp rice vinegar\n\nDirections:\n1. Rinse and drain the rice 2-3 times with cold water\n2. Add the 2 cups of water to the rice and heat up on the stovetop on medium high\r\n3. Right when the water starts to bubble, turn the heat down to medium low.  Give the rice a good stir (removing any that is starting to grab the bottom of the pan), cover the pot, and let it cook for 15min\r\n4. After 15min, turn the heat off and let it continue to steam for another 15min.  Do not let it cook any longer or else the rice will overcook\r\n5. When the rice is done, transfer to a large bowl.  Add the rice vinegar and fluff with a rice paddle or spatula.  Then, gently pat the rice to line the sides of the bowl.  This will accelerate the rice to cool.  Wait 10-15min\n\n\nPICKLED GINGER\n\nIngredients:\n2 large pieces ginger (120g)\r2 cup water\n1 tbsp pink salt\n2 tbsp cane sugar\n\u00bd cup rice vinegar\n3 frozen sweet cherries (or a radish)\n\nDirections:\n1. Peel and slice the ginger into really thin slices\r2. Add the water, ginger, pink salt, and the cherries to a small saucepan and bring to a boil stirring occasionally to dissolve the salt.  The cherry will give the ginger it\u2019s amazing pink color\r3. Once the water comes to a boil, let it cook for about 8min\r\n4. Add the cane sugar to the jar.  Then, transfer one of the cherries to it followed by the ginger slices\r5. Pour in the rice vinegar.  Be sure to pour enough vinegar to submerge all of the ginger but still leaving a little bit of space up top.  Place the lid onto the jar and give it a good shake to dissolve the sugar\r\n6. Transfer to the fridge for at least 2 days before serving\n\n\nCHICKPEA MAYO\n\nIngredients:\n400ml can of chickpeas*\n1 tbsp lemon juice \n1 tbsp canned chickpeas \n1 tbsp dijon mustard \n1 \u00be cups grapeseed/veggie oil \r(drizzle in a little more for an even thicker mayo) \ngenerous pinch pink salt\n\n*this can have me about 3/4 cups of aquafaba (apologies for the audio as it sounds like 3 plus a 1/4 cups)\n\nDirections:\n1. Empty the can of chickpea water (aquafaba) into a small saucepan \r2. Boil the aquafaba on medium high heat for 5-6min stirring often \r\n3. Add some ice to a large mixing bowl, then place a smaller bowl on top of the ice \r\n4. Pour in the chickpea water and stir until cold\r\n5. Transfer the chickpea water to the blender.  Then, add in the Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and 1 tbsp of chickpeas\r\n6. Blend on the highest setting to pulverize the chickpeas. Then, turn it down to medium to medium high\r7. Slowly pour in the oil. The mayo will start to thicken up (adjust and pulse the speed if needed)\r8. Transfer the mayo to a mixing bowl and add a generous pinch of pink salt. Fold to combine\n\n\nORDER YOUR SIGNED VEGAN RAMEN COOKBOOK + GET YOUR FREE E-BOOK + TAKE YOUR VEGAN SUSHI MASTERCLASS HERE:\nhttps://www.yeungmancooking.com\n\nIf you enjoyed this episode and would love to see more, remember to like, comment, and subscribe so that you won't miss a single episode!\n\nHong Kong born Canadian, Wil Yeung is an international photographer, filmmaker, entrepreneur, violinist, and YouTube chef.
